#Hangman game
Hangman game using C++ console. If you don't know the game, you should guess the word by entering a certain number of letters before hanging the man. I added more features like:
- Different levels.
- Anti cheating when you enter more than two letters.
- One help to guess only the first letter of the word.

I have already prepared a word list but obviously you can change it. And i commented some numbers in the code as indicators to help you to change the code depending on your word list.
